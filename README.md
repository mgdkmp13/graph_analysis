# graph_analysis
Project about graphs and it's characteristic features. 

Input of an app is graphs and output are the following parameters:

1. the degree sequence;
2. the number of components;
3. bipartiteness;
4. vertices colours:
  a) greedy
  b) LF method (ties are solved by the vertex number)
5. the number of the graph complement's edges
